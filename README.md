# SALES-DATA-ANALYSIS

Introduction

The world of business thrives on data-driven decisions, and the ability to harness the power of data is essential. In this project, I embark on an exciting journey to analyze sales data, uncover trends, and reveal valuable insights that will drive strategic decision-making.
The primary goal is to extract actionable information from a substantial sales dataset, providing a roadmap for optimizing sales strategies and achieving sustainable growth.


About the Dataset
The dataset has sales data from January 2019 to January 2020. It consists originally of 6 columns which was modified further for the purpose of the analysis;

order_id: Unique identifier for each order placed by a customer

Product: Electronics Products sold by the store

quantity: Quantity ordered for each product

order_date: Date the order was placed

Price Each: Price of each product in USD

Purchase Address: Address of each customer who placed an Order



Business Task
Q1. What is the overall sales trend?

Q2. What are the products performance by revenue?

Q3. What are the Products performance by Quantity?

Q4. What is the Order performance per City?

Q5. When is the peak period of the day?

Q6. What is the revenue contribution between weekdays and weekends?


Analysis
The analysis was done using Microsoft Excel.



Steps
Data Import: I imported and converted the raw data which was in CSV file format into Microsoft Excel.

Data Cleaning: I cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency this included standardizing the formats, and correcting errors.

Data Transformation: I transformed the data to make it suitable for analysis. This transformation includes calculations, aggregations, and filtering operations. I also created new columns required for the analysis using Microsoft Excel.

Data Visualization: Data Visualization: I visualized the analyzed data using the charts and graphs available on Microsoft Excel. I also created a dashboard using the insights from the analyzed data.

Monthly Strategies: Focus on boosting sales during the beginning of the year, particularly in January, through innovative marketing campaigns and product promotions to counter the post-holiday slump.
